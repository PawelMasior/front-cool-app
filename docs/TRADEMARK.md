# Trademark Search Guide

Conducting a trademark search is a crucial step in selecting a brand name to ensure that you’re not infringing on existing trademarks. This can save you from potential legal issues and costly rebranding in the future. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to conduct a trademark search for your chosen names—**Planepy.com**, **Dalongo.com**, and **Plandada.com**.

## 1. Understand What a Trademark Is

A **trademark** is a symbol, word, or phrase legally registered or established by use as representing a company or product. It’s essential to ensure that your chosen name doesn’t infringe on existing trademarks in the same or related industries.

---

## 2. Preliminary Search Steps

### a. Online Search Engines

Start with a simple search on **Google** or other search engines to see if there are existing businesses or products using the names **Planepy**, **Dalongo**, or **Plandada**. This can help identify obvious conflicts.

### b. Domain Availability

While you’re already considering domain names, verifying their availability can also give insight into whether similar names are in use.

## 3. Official Trademark Databases

### a. United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)

If you’re operating in the United States or planning to target the U.S. market, use the USPTO’s Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS).

- **Website:** [USPTO TESS](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/)
- **How to Use:**
  1. Go to the TESS website.
  2. Choose the **Basic Word Mark Search** option.
  3. Enter your desired name (e.g., "Dalongo") and review the results for similar or identical trademarks.
  4. Check the **Goods and Services** categories to see if there are conflicts in your industry.

### b. European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO)

For European markets, use the EUIPO’s eSearch tool.

- **Website:** [EUIPO eSearch](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/)
- **Steps:**
  1. Access the eSearch tool.
  2. Enter the trademark name.
  3. Review existing trademarks for similarities.

### c. Other Countries’ Trademark Offices

If you plan to operate internationally, check the relevant trademark offices in those countries. Some key ones include:

- **Canada:** [Canadian Intellectual Property Office](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/home)
- **Australia:** [IP Australia](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/)
